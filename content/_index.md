I am a Senior Staff Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" class="link-secondary">MongoDB</a>,
focused on the MongoDB query engine. I've worked on various aspects of query optimization and
query execution, with a current focus on query optimization for document
databases. I graduated from Brown University in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science. The same year, I started at MongoDB as one of the founding
members of the MongoDB Query Team. I managed the team from both a technical standpoint
and a people standpoint, growing it to approximately 10 engineers before returning to my
current individual contributor role. Since then, the team has grown to more than 80
engineers distributed across North America and Europe. I continue to work closely with
engineering leadership at the VP level on the technical vision, roadmap, and implementation of all aspects
of query processing at MongoDB.
