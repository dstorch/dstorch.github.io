I am a Senior Staff Software Engineer at MongoDB, focused on the MongoDB
server's query engine. I've worked on various aspects of query optimization and
query execution, with a current focus on query optimization for document
databases. I graduated from Brown University 2013 with a Bachelor's of Science
in Computer Science. The same year, I started at MongoDB as one of the founding
members of the MongoDB Query Team. I managed the team from both a technical standpoint
and a people standpoint, growing it to approximately 10 engineers before returning to my
current individual contributor role.
