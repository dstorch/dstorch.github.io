When I'm not implementing database systems or playing music, you're likely to find me
running (city or trail) or hiking. There's nothing like a long, gruelling adventure on a
sunny weekend morning. Here are a few images from my recent adventures, including a
through-hike of the <a href="https://www.westhighlandway.org/">West Highland Way</a>.
